## Title
Apartment Price Prediction Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

## Overview
Predicted future apartment transaction prices using a comprehensive dataset collected through data scraping from various real estate websites. Addressed multicollinearity issues by removing and combining variables. Employed five variable selection algorithms to extract meaningful independent variables. Applied machine learning and deep learning algorithms and compared their predictive performance after hyperparameter optimization.
